# Simple Elm Web Application


## Development Environment
You can develop for Elm on Linux, Mac OS, or Windows where you can edit a text file and execute the Elm development tools:

•	elm repl – interact with Elm expressions on a command line
•	elm make – most-general way to compile an Elm project to either JavaScript or to html
•	elm reactor – browser-based development environment and test server
•	elm install – adds https://package.elm-lang.org/  dependencies to elm.json (think: npm and package.json)

Run elm help to receive help that is actually … helpful.

The elm.json project file declares the location of test and app source files, the version of the Elm environment, and any included library dependencies.
